#
# Given two integers, num and t. A number is achievable if it can become equal
# to num after applying the following operation:
# 
# 
# Increase or decrease the number by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease
# num by 1.
# 
# 
# Return the maximum achievable number after applying the operation at most t
# times.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: num = 4, t = 1
# 
# Output: 6
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number
# equal to num:
# 
# 
# Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: num = 3, t = 2
# 
# Output: 7
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number
# equal to num:
# 
# 
# Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= num, tÂ <= 50
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
class Solution:
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:
        return num + 2 * t
